# Artimate
Code and data for ArtiMate project. The pre-processed data can be found under the data folder, while the code for the project can be found under the analysis folder. Note that the code is split into two scripts, one for the clustering of OTU data and one for the analysis of the combined data. To run the clustering script the first part of the analysis should be run to link the NDVI values with their appropriate bio-ids. However, when downloading all data, the analysis script may be run without the other. Note that the topsoil data and the DNA data need to be downloaded from the orignal provides due to lisencing issues
